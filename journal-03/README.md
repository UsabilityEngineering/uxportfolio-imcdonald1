## Options Bar Always on Screen

Ian McDonald May 10, 2020

When trying to submit and assignment to blackboard, there is a bar at the bottom of the screen that is stickied to the bottom of the submission screen. This bar holds quick buttons to do critical tasks, such as saving the current submission as a draft, or submitting it. The screenshot included shows the bar at the bottom. This bar can be useful when typing long submissions. It will allow you to quickly save you work. This is both efficient and effective as it is always close and on screen and only takes one click to get the job done.
